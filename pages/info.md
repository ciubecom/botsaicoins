...now ciube wants to use this website to be a "bullhorn" for this multi space about to change the reality of technology.

*GITHUB* is the leader in getting the code out, so it makes sence that github.com should be the home for a long term view and news about fields that are evolving into a powerful planetary force for change – *hopefully* – ciube made a wise choice.


## CIUBE.COM MISSION

* [Professional Site ][8], [Informative Videos][9], [News and Reviews][10], [Interviews][11],...
* TOKEN Blockchain developments
* Robotics vision and trends
* AI and its benefits and threats
* NEWS Aggregator
* Video shares that inform the public
* POSTS that bring understanding and questions



CIUBE would like to give a big thanks to the creator of the theme used for the website.  We are leaving in place the following paragraph written by the author of the theme because it clearly relates how technology can shape our lives.



## I got inspired by...
## ...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2]. Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002. [GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more...

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
