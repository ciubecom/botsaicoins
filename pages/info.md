...now ciube wants to use this website to be a "bullhorn" for this multi space about to change the reality of technology.

*GITHUB* is the leader in getting the code out, so it makes sence that github.com should be the home for a long term view and news about fields that are evolving into a powerful planetary force for change – *hopefully* – ciube made a wise choice.

## I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2]. Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002. [GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more...

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
